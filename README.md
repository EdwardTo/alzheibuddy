# Alzhei Buddy on Google Glass #
Our application is developed to help patients with Alzheimers and Dementia to help them remember who people are and their relationship with them through the use of facial recognition. 


## Usage ##

* When the app is on, say "OK Glass"
* When prompted, say "Detect Faces" to detect a face that is currently on the screen
